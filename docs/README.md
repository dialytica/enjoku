## Game Overview

A sandbox roguelite RPG style game, with a disconnected multiplayer gameplay.
Community driven game stories that can be updated regularly utilizing version
control such as `git` for updating the game world data. Hence the disconnected
multiplayer can be achieved.

Every player have the ability to create a change by doing adventure, creating
items, building a structure, and pick their own AI behavior if the game world
is being played by other player.

> The term AI that I was using before is game NPC behavior related term. Not
> the infamous Large Language Model
